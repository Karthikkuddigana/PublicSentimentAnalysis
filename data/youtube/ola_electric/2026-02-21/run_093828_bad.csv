They didn’t even clean it — just said they “checked brakes” and “updated software.”

Now after the Oct 2025 update, the software is finally okay, but I’ve decided I’m never giving my Ola for service again. I still have scratches and a broken rear number-plate LED, and I’m avoiding service on purpose.
